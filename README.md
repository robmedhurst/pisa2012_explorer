# pisa2012_explorer
This project aims to develop tools to assist with the wrangling and exploration of the PISA 2012 dataset. Specifically, groups of similar variables are explored concurrently.

**Note:** This project was created as an exercise.

**The PISA 2012 Dataset is not distributed with this project.**



## Initial Input
**dependent variables:**  List(s) of similar variables from the 2012 PISA Dataset.

**independent variables:**  A list of similar independent variables from the Dataset, requires numerical type.

## Initial Actions
+ drop unused columns and nulls
+ convert categorical variables in to readable and uniform values
+ convert numerical values from string
+ create counts for lists of similar binary variables
+ create means for lists of similar floats variables

## Univariate Processes Available
+ graph a group of variables side by side
+ get long name with description

## Bivariate Processes Available
+ graph group against mean

## Multivariate Processes Available
+
