# pisa2012_explorer
This project is a collection of wrangling and graphing functions created as an exercise for exploration of the PISA 2012 dataset.
+ **A means of quickly wranging and exploring groups of similar variables in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment data**
+ **An experiment in learning and introduction to data structure and interface**
+ **A cheat sheet for matplotlib and seaborn functions (graphics.graphics)**

**The PISA 2012 Dataset is not distributed with this project.**

Variables are visualized through customized matplotlib and seaborn plot functions.
Plots can be saved and reloaded to edit via pickled buffer saved to file.
Groups of similar variables can be explored concurretly if they are of a
known category.


1. User selects and names groups of similar variables of interest (groups may contain a single variable or list of similar variables).

2. Plotting options are offered in stages: Single Variable, Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate. In each stage, user selects from groups, then chooses from plots that pertain to selected group(s).



==============================================================
## Usage examples

    # TODO: usage examples

## Functions
    # TODO: list functions with examples, use docstrings where appropriate

### Pre-exploration (wrangling)
+ drop unused columns and nulls
+ convert categorical variables in to readable and uniform values
+ convert numerical values from string
+ create counts for lists of similar binary variables
+ create means for lists of similar floats variables

### Univariate Processes Available

### Bivariate Processes Available

### Multivariate Processes Available
